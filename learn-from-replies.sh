# Only EXPLICIT, OPT-IN signal is consumed: comments containing
# `/srosro-memorize` posted by trusted (push-access) repo collaborators
# after a bot review on the same PR. The earlier heuristic filter
# (looks_like_review_reply) over-included noise — bot replies, tangential
# human chatter, anything that happened to mention @<bot> or quote a
# severity tag. The slash command makes the signal opt-in: a human is
# explicitly asking the bot to remember a lesson, the trust gate keeps
# drive-by commenters from mutating the rule list, and the "after a bot
# review" sequencing keeps the request anchored to actual review context.
#
# REVIEW_PRACTICES.md and TESTING.md are not auto-tuned here. They are
# hand-curated; auto-tune targets only the mistakes file.

PROMPT="You maintain a ranked top-48 list of review-calibration rules based on EXPLICIT, OPT-IN feedback. Each new signal is a comment containing \`/srosro-memorize\` posted by a trusted (push-access) human collaborator after a bot review on the same PR — they're explicitly asking the bot to remember a lesson. This list is rewritten end-to-end on each update — it is not append-only. Your default action is to make the SMALLEST possible change that captures new signal; over-writing the whole list for one datapoint is a failure mode.

INPUTS:
- The current \`COMMENT_REVIEW_MISTAKES.md\` (the list you are editing)
- New /srosro-memorize requests (each is a trusted human's explicit ask to remember something)

YOUR JOB:

1. For each new signal, infer the UNDERLYING PATTERN the human is teaching — NOT the specific instance. If they wrote 'this manifest mirroring doesn't need dedup,' the pattern is 'don't demand refactors when parity/drift tests adequately cover the risk.' Generalize before writing. No file paths, no specific PR references, no company-specific details — those belong in a commit message, not in a durable rule.

2. Decide what to do with each signal:
   - **Match an existing item** → merge it in (implicit: the item stays or moves up in rank). Do not add a near-duplicate.
   - **Genuinely new general pattern** → add it, but only if the pattern would plausibly repeat on FUTURE PRs. One-off observations are not rules.
   - **Not a clear calibration lesson** (vague request, just thanks/acknowledgment, or '/srosro-memorize' with nothing actionable after it) → ignore it.
   - **Soften an existing rule** → if the signal contradicts a too-broad rule, NARROW or soften that rule rather than adding a new one alongside.

3. Produce the updated list. Keep the format EXACTLY:
   - Numbered list, 1..N, with N ≤ 48.
   - Each line: \`N. <pattern statement>. <why it matters, one clause>.\`
   - No source tag prefix.
   - Under ~200 chars per item. Patterns, not case studies.
   - Ranked by importance: frequently-seen patterns outrank one-offs.
   - If the list exceeds 48 items after edits, DROP the lowest-ranked items.
   - Preserve the header text above the numbered list.

4. Produce a per-request acknowledgment inside an <ACKS> block. For each /srosro-memorize request, emit one <ACK> line that names the request by its key and explains in ONE CONCISE LINE what you did: what rule you added, what existing rule you softened, or that you made no change and why. ACK every request — the human asked you to remember something, so silence is wrong; tell them what happened.

ACK constraints:
- One line per ACK, under ~200 chars, plain prose.
- Do NOT use \`@${BOT_USER}\`, \`/srosro-review\`, \`/srosro-update-review\`, or \`/srosro-memorize\` in the ACK body (those would either trigger a re-review loop or recursively register as a new memorize request on the next tick).
- Focus on what changed (or didn't), not pleasantries.

OUTPUT FORMAT — exactly this shape, nothing else:

<COMMENT_REVIEW_MISTAKES>
...full updated file contents (header + numbered list)...
</COMMENT_REVIEW_MISTAKES>
<ACKS>
<ACK key=\"repo#pr#commentid\">One-line what-I-did.</ACK>
...
</ACKS>

Default to conservative edits. If a request doesn't clearly indicate a generalizable rule, leave the list unchanged and ACK with what you considered and why you didn't update. Quality over volume.
