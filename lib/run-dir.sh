# Sourceable helper for allocating a per-run dir. Lives outside
# review-one-pr.sh so the regression smoke can exercise the same
# function the worker calls (instead of testing a copy).
#
# Caller must already have LOG_FILE + PR_ID set up so log() works.

# allocate_run_dir RUN_DIR
#
# Creates RUN_DIR (and agents/, inputs/) as a unit, or fails loud:
#   - collision (RUN_DIR already exists): logs "collision", returns 1.
#     This converts the silent-overwrite hazard from same-second
#     RUN_ID retries into a loud worker abort. Strict no-overwrite
#     invariant — held regardless of timestamp granularity, holds
#     against any future change that could produce duplicate IDs.
#   - parent-create failure (typically EACCES / ENOSPC under
#     $STATE_DIR/runs): logs the path + returns 1.
#   - mkdir failure on RUN_DIR for any non-EEXIST reason: logs +
#     returns 1.
#   - success: returns 0 with RUN_DIR/{agents,inputs} created.
