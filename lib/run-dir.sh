# Sourceable helper for allocating a per-run dir. Lives outside
# review-one-pr.sh so the regression smoke can exercise the same
# function the worker calls (instead of testing a copy).
#
# Caller must already have LOG_FILE + PR_ID set up so log() works.

# allocate_run_dir RUN_DIR
#
# Creates RUN_DIR (and agents/, inputs/) as a unit, or fails loud:
#   - collision (RUN_DIR already exists): logs "collision", returns 1.
#     This converts the silent-overwrite hazard from same-second
#     RUN_ID retries into a loud worker abort. Strict no-overwrite
#     invariant — held regardless of timestamp granularity, holds
#     against any future change that could produce duplicate IDs.
#   - parent-create failure (typically EACCES / ENOSPC under
#     $STATE_DIR/runs): logs the path + returns 1.
#   - mkdir failure on RUN_DIR for any non-EEXIST reason: logs +
#     returns 1.
#   - success: returns 0 with RUN_DIR/{agents,inputs} created.

# stage_prior_reviews STATE_DIR REPO_SLUG PR_NUM CURRENT_RUN_DIR
#
# Walks $STATE_DIR/runs/<repo-slug>__<pr>__* dirs in chronological order
# (sortable by RUN_TS) and concatenates each prior aggregator output to
# stdout, separated by `--- review at <ts> ---` headers. The current run
# is excluded explicitly. Run dirs from other PRs are filtered by the
# slug+pr glob. Run dirs without an aggregator output (aborted runs that
# never reached the aggregator phase) are skipped.
#
# Empty stdout when this is the first review on the PR. Caller checks
# `[ -n "$result" ]` and decides whether to write_scratch the result.
#
# Pure read-only walk; no side effects. Lives here so the smoke test in
# lib/tests/prior-reviews-smoke.sh exercises the same function the
# worker calls — a wrong glob, missing self-exclusion, or empty-file
# filter regression silently disables Bug-Class-Recurrence detection
# without tripping any other test.
