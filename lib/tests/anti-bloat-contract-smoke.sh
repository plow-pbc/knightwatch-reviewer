# Smoke: anti-bloat prompt-contract sync.
#
# Token-level sync check between prompts/common-header.md, prompts/critic.md,
# and prompts/aggregator.md — ensures the REMEDY-BLOAT handshake stays
# intact across edits to either side, and Rule 8 (Remedy-cost framing)
# survives in common-header.md.
#
# Deliberately NOT a content-pinning test. Rule 8 itself forbids tests
# that calcify prompt prose; what we fence here is contract integrity
# (token presence, branch-negative alternative still allowed), not literal
# wording.
#
# Failure modes this catches:
#   - REMEDY-BLOAT removed from critic.md but not aggregator.md (or vice versa)
#   - Rule 8 deleted entirely from common-header.md
#   - aggregator handler narrowed back to LOC-only (loses the branch-negative
#     framing aligned with Rule 8's cost model — conditionals + special cases
#     + defensive branches + new abstractions)
